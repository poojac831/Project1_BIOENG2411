# Analyzing 2022 COVID Data with relation to Multigenerational Household and Poverty Data
The goal of this project is to analyze the cumulative number of deaths in US counties with relation to the number of multigenerational households. I will also be looking into the percentage of households below the poverty line with relation to these two factors as well. Multigenerational families were chosen because there tends to be more older people in these families and age makes people more susceptible to infection. Multigenerational families also tend to be less susceptible to poverty so it will be interesting to see how the cumulative death counts compare.
